## Example Interactions

### **Goal Prioritization**

```
User: "I have too many goals and feel overwhelmed"

AI Response: "I can see you have 12 active goals across 4 categories. Based on your task completion rate of 78%, you're actually quite productive! Let me help you prioritize:

üéØ **High Priority** (based on your recent progress):
- Complete the React course (you're 60% done)
- Launch the side project (2 tasks remaining)

üìä **Your Pattern**: You complete 3-4 tasks per week, so focusing on 2-3 goals at a time works best for you.

üí° **Recommendation**: Try the Goal Achiever module to break down your goals into manageable milestones."
```

### **Habit Building**

```
User: "I want to build better habits but keep failing"

AI Response: "Looking at your current habits, I see you have 5 active habits with a 65% completion rate. That's actually above average! Here's what I notice:

‚úÖ **Your Strengths**:
- You're consistent with morning routines
- You track your habits regularly

üîÑ **Areas for Improvement**:
- Evening habits have lower completion rates
- Weekend consistency drops to 45%

üí° **Actionable Advice**:
1. Start with just 1 new habit this week (timeline: today)
2. Link it to an existing successful habit (benefit: 40% higher success rate)
3. Use the Habit Master module for better tracking

üéØ **Recommended Module**: Habit Master - it's perfect for your habit-building journey!"
```

### **Module Recommendations**

```
User: "What modules should I try next?"

AI Response: "Based on your data, here are my top recommendations:

üèÜ **Priority 1 - Budget Optimizer**:

- Your learning style shows you prefer structured approaches
- Connection: Would accelerate your skill development goals

‚è∞ **Priority 3 - Time Blocker**:
