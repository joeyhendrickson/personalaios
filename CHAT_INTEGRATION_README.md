### Example Conversations

**Creating a Goal:**

**Getting Point Suggestions:**

```
User: "How many points should 'Build a todo app' be worth?"
AI: "Based on the complexity of building a todo app, I'd suggest 8-12 points. This accounts for the planning, implementation, and testing phases. Would you like me to create this task for you?"
