# Activity Tracking & Premium Users Update

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. **Activity Tracking Now Excludes Admin Users**

**What Changed:**

- Updated `src/hooks/use-activity-tracking.ts` to check if the user is an admin
- Admin users are **no longer tracked** in activity logs
- Trial, Standard, and Premium users **ARE tracked**

**Implementation:**

```typescript
const { isAdmin } = useAdminAuth()
const shouldTrack = !isAdmin

// All activity logging now checks shouldTrack before executing
if (!shouldTrack) return
```

**What Gets Tracked (for non-admin users only):**

- ✅ Session starts and ends
- ✅ Page visits
- ✅ Time spent on platform
- ✅ Mouse/keyboard activity
- ✅ Task/goal creation events

**What's Stored:**

- `user_activity_logs` table - detailed activity entries
- `user_analytics_summary` table - aggregated stats (visits, time spent)

---

### 2. **Premium Users Now Visible in Admin Dashboard**

**Account Type Logic:**

- **Trial**: Users in `trial_subscriptions` table
- **Standard**: Users in `subscriptions` table with `plan_type = 'standard'`
- **Premium**: All other authenticated users (not trial, not standard, not admin)

**What Changed:**

1. **API (`src/app/api/admin/dashboard/route.ts`):**
   - Identifies Premium users automatically
   - Calculates Premium user stats (total, active, with activity)
   - Returns Premium user data with analytics

2. **UI (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`):**
   - Added new "Premium" module card
   - Shows Premium user list with:
     - Name and email
     - Total points
     - Visit count
     - Time spent
     - Last activity date
   - Stats header shows: Total, Active (last 7 days), With Activity

## 📊 Admin Dashboard View

The admin dashboard now shows **4 user categories**:

1. **Trial** (green icon)
   - Active, Near Expiry, Converted stats
   - Shows trial period and notification status

2. **Standard** (blue icon)
   - Total, Active, Grace Period stats
   - Shows subscription status and payment info

3. **Premium** (purple icon) - **NEW!**
   - Total, Active, With Activity stats
   - Shows user engagement and points

4. **All Users** (bottom table)
   - Combined view of all user types
   - Shows visits, time spent, points

## 🔒 Data Safety

**No data was modified or lost:**

- ✅ All existing user accounts remain intact
- ✅ All tasks, goals, habits, projects, priorities preserved
- ✅ All points and rewards data unchanged
- ✅ Only **display logic** and **categorization** was updated
- ✅ Activity tracking is **additive only** (no data deletion)

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Activity Tracking is now live** for:

- ✅ Your sister's account (Premium user) - will track from now on
- ✅ All Trial users
- ✅ All Standard users
- ✅ All Premium users

**Admin account (your account):**

- ❌ Will NOT be tracked (by design)
- ✅ Still shows up in admin dashboard with full data
- ✅ Can view all other users' activity

---

## 📝 Notes

**Why Premium users might show 0 visits:**

- Activity tracking only starts **from now forward**
- Users who signed up before this update won't have historical activity logs
- Their tasks/goals/points are still tracked and visible
- Activity logs will populate as they use the platform going forward

**To backfill historical activity (optional):**

- We can create a script to estimate visits/time based on task creation dates
- This would populate "visits" and "time spent" retroactively
- Let me know if you want this feature!
