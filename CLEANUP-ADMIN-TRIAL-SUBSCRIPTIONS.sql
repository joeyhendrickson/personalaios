-- CLEANUP ADMIN TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS
-- ========================================================================
-- This script removes any trial subscriptions that were incorrectly created
-- for admin users. Admin accounts should NEVER have trial subscriptions.

-- Delete trial subscriptions for admin users
DELETE FROM trial_subscriptions

);

-- Show which admin users had trial subscriptions (for logging)

FROM admin_users au
WHERE au.is_active = true
  AND au.email IN (

  );

-- Verify cleanup
SELECT 
  'Remaining trial subscriptions' as status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM trial_subscriptions ts
JOIN admin_users au ON ts.email = au.email
WHERE au.is_active = true;

-- Show all current admin users (should have no trial subscriptions)
