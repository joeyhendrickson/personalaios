## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Resend API Key (get from https://resend.com/api-keys)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Cron Job Secret (generate a random string)
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-here

# App URL (for email links)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.lifestacks.ai
```

### 2. Resend Setup

1. Sign up at [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Verify your domain (lifestacks.ai)
3. Create an API key
4. Add the API key to your environment variables

### 3. Database Schema

Run the SQL migration in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
create-trial-system-complete.sql
```

This creates:

- `trial_subscriptions` table with email notification tracking fields
- `subscriptions` table for post-trial paid subscriptions
- Proper RLS policies and indexes

### 4. Vercel Cron Job

The system uses Vercel Cron Jobs to automatically check for expiring trials.

**Configuration**: `vercel-cron.json`

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/check-trials",
      "schedule": "0 */12 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

This runs every 12 hours (midnight and noon UTC).

**Cron Endpoint**: `/api/cron/check-trials`

- Protected by `CRON_SECRET` authentication
- Checks for trials expiring in 48 hours
- Sends appropriate notifications
- Updates notification tracking fields

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

4. **Resend Dashboard**: Check for rejected emails

### Cron Not Running

1. **Check Vercel Cron**: Ensure `vercel-cron.json` is deployed
2. **CRON_SECRET**: Verify environment variable is set
3. **Manual Test**: Try manual trigger to test logic

### Notifications Not Tracking

1. **Database Fields**: Ensure notification fields exist in table
2. **RLS Policies**: Check Supabase policies allow updates
3. **Check Response**: Review API response for errors
